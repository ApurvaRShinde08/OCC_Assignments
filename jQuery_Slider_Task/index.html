                    <p>The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen’s helpers: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.</p>

                    <h2>Slide Two</h2>
                    <p>The Cockalier is a mixed breed dog — a cross between the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Cocker Spaniel dog breeds. Friendly, gentle, and intelligent, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of their parents.</p>

                    <p>An adorable, small dog with the personality of a big clown, the Cockapoo is perhaps the first of the “designer dogs” (not a purebred dog breed), dating back to the 1960s, rather than to just a few years ago. </p>
